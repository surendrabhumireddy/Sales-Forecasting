# Sales Prediction Project

This repository contains code and resources for a sales prediction project using machine learning.

## Overview
Sales prediction is a crucial task for businesses to optimize inventory, plan marketing strategies, and forecast revenue. This project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts sales based on historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical sales data, including date, product attributes, and sales volume. The data is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

## Model Building
Several machine learning algorithms are explored for sales prediction, including linear regression, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting. After evaluating the performance, the random forest algorithm is chosen as the best-performing model due to its accuracy and robustness.

## Evaluation
The performance of the random forest model achieved an accuracy of 95%, making it the best model for sales prediction in this project.
